Write-Host "1. If no pen devices detected:"
Write-Host "   - Ensure your tablet/stylus is properly connected"
Write-Host "   - Check Device Manager for pen/tablet devices"

Write-Host "`n2. If no audio devices found:"
Write-Host "   - Check Windows Sound settings"
Write-Host "   - Ensure speakers/headphones are connected"
Write-Host "   - Try running as Administrator"

Write-Host "`n3. To test pen input manually:"
Write-Host "   - Open Windows Ink Workspace"
Write-Host "   - Try drawing in Sketchpad"
Write-Host "   - If that does not work, the issue is with pen setup"

Write-Host "`n4. To test with console output:"
Write-Host "   - Close any running Artisense instances"
Write-Host "   - Run: cd artifacts-debug && .\Artisense.UI.exe"
Write-Host "   - Look for log messages when drawing"
