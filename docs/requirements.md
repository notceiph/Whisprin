# Artisense MVP Requirements Specification

## 1. Core Functional Requirements

### F1. Global Pen Input Detection

### D2. Security
- **D2.1** MUST pass VirusTotal scan without false positives
- **D2.2** MUST build Windows SmartScreen reputation
- **D2.3** MUST sign executable with valid code signing certificate

## 5. Quality Requirements

### Q1. Code Quality
- **Q1.1** MUST pass StyleCop analysis with zero violations
- **Q1.2** MUST pass Roslyn analyzers with zero critical issues
- **Q1.3** MUST pass SonarLint with zero critical issues
- **Q1.4** MUST maintain >90% test coverage for new code

### Q2. Reliability

- **Q2.2** MUST handle device disconnection/reconnection gracefully
- **Q2.3** MUST run continuously for 24+ hours without degradation
- **Q2.4** MUST work across app switching and multiple monitor scenarios

## 6. Test Acceptance Criteria

### T1. Functional Tests
- Pressure detection works in Photoshop, Krita, and Windows Paint
- Audio volume responds correctly to pressure changes
- Tray interface controls work as expected
- Application starts and stops cleanly

### T2. Performance Tests

- Works with Surface Pen and Wacom Intuos
- No conflicts with other applications
- Clean installation and uninstallation

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline Requirements

### CI1. Build Pipeline
- **CI1.1** MUST build on every pull request
- **CI1.2** MUST run full test suite on every pull request
