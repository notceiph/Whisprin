# Artisense Optimization Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the phased implementation of optimizations identified in `fixes.md` to achieve MVP performance requirements (latency ≤15ms p50, CPU <5% active, memory <30MB). It follows clean code principles: meaningful naming, single responsibility, logical organization, comprehensive documentation, and ≥90% test coverage. Tasks are granular, with dependencies, priorities (Critical/High/Medium/Low), estimated effort (hours), and acceptance criteria. Assignee: Dev Team (single developer assumed). Status tracked via checkboxes. Incremental delivery via feature branches with CI/CD validation.

## Phase 1: Foundation
**Focus**: Setup infrastructure and critical fixes to ensure stable base. Dependencies: None. Risks: CI setup delays - Mitigation: Use existing build.ps1 as template. Quality Gate: All setup passes StyleCop/Roslyn/SonarLint; pipeline runs successfully.

- [ ] **Task 1.1: Enforce Release Mode and Optimizations in Build Script** (Priority: Critical, Effort: 1h, Dependencies: None)
  - **Description**: Update build.ps1 to enforce Release mode (/optimize+), enable nullable references, treat warnings as errors. Add AOT if .NET 7+ for startup perf (G2).
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Build succeeds in Release; startup time <200ms benchmarked; single exe <6MB.
  - **Assignee**: Dev Team

- [ ] **Task 1.2: Set Up/Enhance CI/CD Pipeline for Performance Regression Detection** (Priority: High, Effort: 2h, Dependencies: Task 1.1)
  - **Description**: Update GitHub Actions to run benchmarks (latency/CPU/memory) on every PR, fail on regressions (CI2.1-CI2.4, G3). Include Wacom Intuos Pro S simulation.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Pipeline fails on simulated regression; artifacts include benchmark reports; covers Win10/11.
  - **Assignee**: Dev Team

- [ ] **Task 1.3: Establish Clean Code Standards and Testing Framework** (Priority: High, Effort: 1-2h, Dependencies: Task 1.2)
  - **Description**: Update stylecop.json for C# 10 conventions; ensure ≥90% coverage for new code. Add docstrings for all public members (Q1.1-Q1.4).
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Zero StyleCop violations; test suite runs with 90%+ coverage; PlantUML diagram for Input→Audio path.
  - **Assignee**: Dev Team

## Phase 2: Core Improvements
**Focus**: Major fixes and refactoring for Input/Audio/Controller. Dependencies: Phase 1 complete. Risks: Breaking event forwarding - Mitigation: Unit tests for each service. Quality Gate: End-to-end latency benchmark ≤15ms p50; active CPU <5%; all functional tests pass (T1/T2).

- [ ] **Task 2.1: Implement InputService Optimizations (F1.1-F1.3)** (Priority: Critical, Effort: 4h, Dependencies: Phase 1)
  - **Description**: Simplify terminal detection (cache GetClassName, skip non-contact); optimize IsPenMessage with HashSet and Wacom priority; reduce logging to async/conditional. Refactor for single responsibility (e.g., separate PenDetector class).
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Hook callback <2ms execution; no false positives on Wacom Intuos Pro S; events forward correctly; updated tests with simulated extraInfo.
  - **Assignee**: Dev Team

- [ ] **Task 2.2: Implement AudioService Core Fixes (F2.1-F2.2)** (Priority: Critical, Effort: 4h, Dependencies: Task 2.1)
  - **Description**: Tune WASAPI buffer to 10-20ms dynamic; vectorize volume loop with System.Numerics; apply perceptual curve only on changes. Ensure small functions (<50 lines).
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: p95 latency ≤18ms; CPU <3% active; seamless looping verified (F2.4); benchmarks show improvement.
  - **Assignee**: Dev Team

- [ ] **Task 2.3: Refactor CoreController for Async Handling (F3.1)** (Priority: High, Effort: 2h, Dependencies: Task 2.2)
  - **Description**: Add async/await for Start/SetPressure; use SynchronizationContext. Organize into logical methods with descriptive names.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: No blocking on UI thread; latency spikes prevented; integration tests pass for Q2.2 reconnection.
  - **Assignee**: Dev Team

- [ ] **Task 2.4: Enhance Error Handling and Logging (G1)** (Priority: Medium, Effort: 2h, Dependencies: Task 2.3)
  - **Description**: Use #if DEBUG for hot path logs; ILogger.Trace for production. Add try-catch with meaningful exceptions.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Idle CPU <0.5%; structured logs; no console output in release.
  - **Assignee**: Dev Team

## Phase 3: Enhancement
**Focus**: Advanced optimizations and memory improvements. Dependencies: Phase 2 complete. Risks: Underruns from small buffers - Mitigation: Fallback logic and hardware tests. Quality Gate: Memory <25MB peak; 24h leak test passes; advanced benchmarks meet targets.

- [ ] **Task 3.1: Enhance Audio Idle Disposal (F2.3)** (Priority: High, Effort: 2h, Dependencies: Phase 2)

- [ ] **Task 3.3: Add Advanced Benchmarks and Integration (G3)** (Priority: Medium, Effort: 2-3h, Dependencies: Task 3.2)
  - **Description**: New benchmarks for hook/volume; update CI to include them. Ensure cross-device compatibility (Wacom/Surface).
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Benchmarks archived; pipeline fails on regressions; full integration tests pass (T3).
  - **Assignee**: Dev Team

## Phase 4: Finalization
**Focus**: Polish and prepare for deployment. Dependencies: Phase 3 complete. Risks: Documentation gaps - Mitigation: Automated checks in CI. Quality Gate: Full QA passes; deployment ready; all requirements met (Definition of Done).

- [ ] **Task 4.1: Final Code Review and QA** (Priority: Critical, Effort: 2h, Dependencies: Phase 3)
  - **Description**: Peer review all changes; run SonarLint/Roslyn; validate performance with WPR/WPA.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Zero critical issues; ≥90% coverage; benchmarks confirm targets (T2).
